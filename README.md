# shidbod
Just a little dumb bot to help you out.

To run the bot, make sure you have python 3 installed on your computer. By default the IDLE comes with it.
Go to the terminal or CMD and perform the following:

pip install wikipedia

pip install bs4

pip install flask

pip install pywhatkit



Download the folder shidbod. Make sure the code and the words.txt file is in the same folder. You can run it either by openning the folder in an IDE or from the CMD directly (Windows). For Mac users you can try the same thing but in Mac terminology or just open from the IDE.
To do this, enter in cd <Path to the folder>.
  Then enter python main.py

What this does is it tell the CMD where to look and then to run the program.
