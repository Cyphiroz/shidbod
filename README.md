Just a little dumb bot to help you out.

To run the bot, make sure you have python 3 installed on your computer. By default the IDLE comes with it.
Go to the terminal or CMD and perform the following:

pip install wikipedia

pip install bs4

pip install flask

pip install pywhatkit



The other libraries needed are preinstalled with python.

Then you can run it from the IDLE. So far the code does not directly work when you click on it from the file explorer.
